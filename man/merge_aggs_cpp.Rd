\arguments{
\item{V_pcs, V_area, V_perimeter, V_npts}{Metadata associated with each each tile.
(Updated)}

\item{E_from, E_to}{Length \code{num_edges} vectors associated with each pair of
adjacent tiles. Specifies the two tiles that each border (0-indexed). (Updated)}

\item{E_npts, E_area, E_edge_length, E_pcs_merge}{Metadata associated with each pair of
adjacent tiles. (Updated)}

each pair of adjacent tiles. (Updated)}
}
\value{
A list of \code{orig_num_tiles} vectors, disjoint sets specifying the IDs for which
of the original tiles have been merged together. Some vectors will have length 0.
}
\description{
Note that this function mutates many of the inputs to keep
track of updated values for tiles and their borders after
each successive merge. Every merge of adjacent tiles has an
associated score (higher means merging is more favorable).
Merging is conducted greedily, one step of a time, updating
the score associated with pair of tiles at each step.
