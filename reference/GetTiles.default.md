# Run full DMT segmentation pipeline to make aggregated tiles from cells

Segmentation has four main steps:

1.  **Preparing data structures:** A triangle mesh is constructed using
    Delauney triangulation and pruned to eliminate long edges. PC
    embeddings for each each are computed.

2.  **Computing gradients:** Gradients are calculated at each point by
    considering the difference in expression between each cell in its
    neighbors in the mesh. These gradients are smoothed using
    (anisotropic) bilateral filtering, and then gradients are defined
    for edges and triangles in the mesh by averaging the points that
    each edge or triangle contains.

3.  **DMT:** A scalar field is defined by taking the magnitude of the
    total gradient at each point/edge/triangle. Then DMT-based
    segmentation is performed by constructing a maximum spanning forest
    on the triangles and a minimum spanning forest on the points.
    Separatrices that separate cells into tiles of homogeneous
    composition are defined by tracing paths between critical points,
    particularly between saddle edges and maximum triangles.

4.  **Aggregation:** Tiles from DMT-based segmentation are merged using
    single-linkage agglomerative clustering to obtain tiles containing a
    number of cells between a user-provided minimum and maximum value.
    Pairs of adjacent tiles are scored according to their
    transcriptional similarity, compactness of shape after merging, and
    number of cells in order to prioritize favorable merges in each
    agglomerative clustering step.

## Arguments

- X, Y:

  A pair of numeric vectors with the coordinates for each of `num_cells`
  points.

- counts:

  A `num_genes` x `num_cells` gene-by-cell matrix of transcript counts.
  Optional if `embeddings` are provided directly.

- embeddings:

  A `num_cells` x `num_dim` matrix of cell embeddings across all latent
  dimensions. If missing, cell embeddings are calculated using PCA. If
  provided, the `npcs` parameter is ignored.

- loadings:

  (Optional) A `num_genes` x `num_dim` matrix of gene loadings.

- meta_data:

  A data frame with additional cell metadata to include in `dmt$pts`.

- meta_vars_include:

  Names of columns in meta_data to include in `dmt$pts`.

- group.by:

  Name of column in `meta_data` that provides the group IDs. Tessera
  tiles are constructed separately for each group (which could be
  separate experimental samples or FOVs).

- npcs:

  Number of PCs to compute for input to segmentation. Ignored if
  `embeddings` are provided directly.

- smooth_emb:

  Number of smoothing iterations to perform on the cell embeddings prior
  to gradient computation. If a vector, then embeddings after each
  specified iteration are concatenated. If `0` is included, then the
  original embeddings are also included.

- prune_thresh_quantile:

  Floating point value between 0 and 1, inclusive. Quantile of edge
  length above which edges are pruned. Defaults to 0.95.

- prune_min_cells:

  Minimum number of cells required for a connected component of
  triangles to be kept. Defaults to 10.

- prune_thresh:

  Edge length above which edges are pruned. If equal to NA, then this
  value is ignored and `thresh_quantile` is used to compute the
  threshold. Otherwise, if `thresh` is set, then `thresh_quantile` is
  ignored. Defaults to NA.

- smooth_distance:

  One of `c('none', 'euclidean', 'projected', 'constant')`. If either
  `smooth_distance` or `smooth_similarity` is `'none'`, then no
  smoothing of the gradient field is conducted. Defaults to
  `'projected'`.

- smooth_similarity:

  One of `c('none', 'euclidean', 'projected', 'constant')`. If either
  `smooth_distance` or `smooth_similarity` is `'none'`, then no
  smoothing of the gradient field is conducted. Defaults to
  `'projected'`.

- smooth_iter:

  Number of rounds of gradient smoothing.

- max_npts:

  Maximum number of cells allowed in each tile during the agglomerative
  clustering phase.

- min_npts:

  Minimum number of cells allowed in each tile during the agglomerative
  clustering phase.

- alpha:

  Parameter for scoring transcriptional similarity between adjacent
  tiles during the agglomerative clustering phase. For `alpha`, 0.2 =
  conservative merging, 2 = liberal merging.

- future.globals.maxSize:

  Maximum allowed size (in bytes) of global variables that are exported
  to each parallel worker. Increase this value if you get an error about
  global object size. Default is 8\*1024^3 (8 GB).

- consolidate:

  Whether to consolidate results from multiple groups into a single
  collection of points and tiles (TRUE) or to return a list of separate
  results for each group (FALSE).

- verbose:

  Whether to print progress messages for each stage of the segmentation
  pipeline.

## Value

      [`GetTiles()`](https://korsunskylab.github.io/tessera/reference/GetTiles.md)
      (`X`, `Y`, `counts`, `meta_data`)

    - Columns from `meta_vars_include`.

    - `f`: Scalar value used for initial DMT-based segmentation,
      computed from the spatial gradient in expression at each point.

      only have two vertices (the endpoints of the boundary edge).

    - `f`: Scalar value used for initial DMT-based segmentation,
      computed from the spatial gradient in expression for triangle.

  - `edges`: A data table with `num_edges` rows containing edges between

      connected by an edge.

    - `from_tri`,`to_tri`: Indices of the two adjacent triangles that

      proportionally larger magnitude.

## Details

### Computing gradients (smoothing)

Gradient fields are smoothed using bilateral filtering, in which the
smoothed gradient of each point is computed as the weighted average of
the neighbors' gradients, considering both distance in space and also
similarity in gradients. The weight of each neighbor is computed from
the product of two scores:

- `distance` score: Generally, closer neighbors have greater weight.

  - if `'euclidean'`: Gaussian transformation of the Euclidean distance
    of a cell from its neighbor, so that more distant neighbors have
    less weight.

  - if `'projected'`: An anisotropic filter that accounts for expected
    change in expression along the direction of the neighbor. The
    expected change in expression is calculated from the gradient field
    as the total derivative in the direction of the neighbor. This
    change in expression is then Gaussian transformed so that neighbors
    that are more distant along the direction of greatest change have
    less weight.

  - if `'constant'`: All neighbors have equal `distance` weights

- `similarity` score: Generally, neighbors with more similar gradients
  have greater weight

  - if `'euclidean'`: Gaussian transformation of the Euclidean distance
    between a cell's gradient field and its neighbor's gradient field.

  - if `'projected'`: Gaussian transformation of the cosine distance
    between a cell's gradient field and its neighbor's gradient field.

  - if `'constant'`: All neighbors have equal `similarity` weights

### Aggregation (scores)

Pairs of adjacent tiles are scored according to their transcriptional
similarity, compactness of shape after merging, and number of cells in
order to prioritize favorable merges in each agglomerative clustering
step. The `dscore` for each edge is computed as the product of the
following three factors, where higher scores favor merging of adjacent
tiles:

- `w`: A 2-cluster GMM is used to determine the mean `mu` and standard
  deviation `sig` of the distance between tiles that have similar gene
  expression (Euclidean distance `d` in PC space). Then we define
  `d_mu = mu + sig` and `d_sig = alpha * sig`, and calculate `w` as
  `w = 0.5 - 1 / (1 + exp(-(d - d_mu) / d_sig))`. Ranges from -0.5 to
  0.5. If adjacent tiles are very dissimilar (`d >> d_mu`), then `d` is
  large, and `w` is close to `-0.5`. If adjacent tiles are very similar
  (`d < d_mu`), then `d` is small, and `w` is positive.

- `score_size`: `(1 - npts_from/max_npts) * (1 - npts_to/max_npts)`.
  Ranges from 0 to 1. In the first round of aggregation, if merging the
  two tiles would have a total number of points ≥`max_npts`, then
  `score_size` is set to `-Inf`, which prevents merging. In the second
  round of aggregation, `dscore` is set to `-Inf` if both adjacent tiles
  have at least `min_npts` cells, to prioritize merging of small tiles.

- `dC`: `.5 * (C_merge - C_from - C_to + 1)`. Ranges from 0 to 1.
